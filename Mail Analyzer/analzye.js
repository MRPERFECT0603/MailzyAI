                                     The Infosys Technologies IPO was undersubscribed
                                     In June 1993, Infosys launched its IPO with shares priced at Rs 95 each. It
                                        didn't attract enough buyers initially, so Morgan Stanley stepped in and bought
                                        13% of the shares. 
                                     When the stock listed, it was priced at Rs 145, giving a gain of over 52%. If
                                        you had invested Rs 9,500 in the IPO, it would now be worth over Rs 2 crore,
                                        plus you would have earned nearly Rs 20 lakh in dividends.

                                     What Is An FPO?
                                     FPO stands for Follow on Public Offer, is a process by which the company already
                                        listed on the stock exchange issues shares to the existing shareholders of the
                                        company or to new investors.
                                     The price is set through underwriting, considering market conditions, valuation,
                                        and negotiations. FPO share pricing depends on investor demand, the company's
                                        financial performance, and market conditions.
